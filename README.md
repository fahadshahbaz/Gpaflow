# GPAFlow 💙

**Stop using complicated spreadsheets.** GPAFlow is a high-performance, persistent academic dashboard built to track your academic journey over 4 years, not just calculate it once.


## Why GPAFlow?
Most GPA calculators are "one-and-done." You enter marks, get a result, and it's gone. GPAFlow is different it's your long-term academic companion.

- **Track Trends:** Visualize your SGPA/CGPA progress across 8 semesters with interactive charts.
- **Smart Predictions:** Know exactly what grades you need in the next semester to hit your target CGPA.
- **Persistent Data:** Your records are synced and secured via Supabase, accessible anytime, anywhere.
- **Modern UI:** Built with glassmorphism, fluid animations (`motion/react`), and a mobile-first philosophy.

## Tech Stack
We use the latest tools to ensure the dashboard is fast and reliable:
- **Core:** Next.js (App Router) + React 19
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animations:** `motion/react`
